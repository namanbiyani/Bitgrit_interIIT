# Bitgrit_InterIIT_Winning_submission

Relevant links: [BITGRIT's Data Science Contest](http://www.interiittech.org/events/bitgrit.html) and [Inter-IIT Techmeet 8.0](http://www.interiittech.org/). The Data Science Competition hosted by bitgrit in the Inter IIT Tech Meet 2019 was composed of three rounds:

**Round 1:** This was based on forecasting future exchange rates to hedge currency risks with regards to the USD and the JPY on the basis of historic exchange data and economic news data. We were given a train and test dataset and we had to submit results for test dataset. 

**Round2:** The teams had to explore the given dataset to identify a Data Science use case pertaining to the keywords “attrition” & ”retention” that can extract the maximum value out of the dataset, build the relevant model to implement the use case, and explain its value with regards to the forecasts or justifications that are yielded by the model developed by the team. Submissions were judged by a panel of industry leaders, subject matter experts and Data Science researchers on the basis of Impact, Data Science Prowess, Dataset Utilisation, Accuracy, Innovation and Scope.

**Round3:** We were given a dataset of Healthcare company XYZ which is trying to make the way they manage procedures more efficient by using analytics for emergency patients who show up without prior appointment and our task was to predict how many procedures we should expect using the weather condition and event information around the area so the hospital can have surgeons ready for those patients.

**Overall Position:** 2nd out of 18 IITs
